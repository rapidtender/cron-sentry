Cron-Sentry : error reporting for cron commands
================================================

This is a fork of https://github.com/mediacore/raven-cron. Why the fork?
-------------------------------------------

The original project, raven-cron, didn't preserve stdout neither stderr; it means that if a program outputs anything and exits sucessfully, original raven-cron ignores *all* output.

Another problem is that it doesn't work with commands that accept options, definitively a bug. A [pull request was sent to them](https://github.com/mediacore/raven-cron/pull/4) to support options, but they never said anything, so this fork is currently being maintained by Yipit.


This fork started with the following patches:

* Add support to command options (commit 75ade6d920cbb9f0e84575ca3ed8b568f945727d).
* Preserve stdout and stderr (commit a604f3e0a104ab018fd1c9b35fe989fdd0834a4b).
* Python 3 support, added by @Ian-Foote (commit a0b74c504e748a821fd07236204c52439cc1b1e9).

After the patches above, the project was renamed to Cron-Sentry so that it can become an independent project (get new features, more bugfixes, new PyPI package).

----


Cron-Sentry is a command-line wrapper that reports errors to
[Sentry](http://getsentry.com) if the script exits with an exit status other
than zero.

-------

`pip install cron-sentry`
